# Exercise

## Card game maker

Your mission is to build a card game maker (simple cards, invent your owns or use existing ones as [Cards Against Humanity](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/)). The app must be able to do:

- Show a detailed view of a card
- Show a card list of your game
- Add a new card
- Edit an existing card

We would love to see each of these features implemented but you are free to add as many features as you want. Some suggestions:

- Export to PDF
- Import/Export to JSON
- Fetch cards from a remote path (Git...)

# Technology

Our stack is composed by the following technologies:

- React + Redux
- Redux-Saga
- Styled-Components
- Redux Form
- React Router

Feel free to use whatever stack you want. (React is a must ðŸ˜¬)

# Bonus points

- You follow clean coding practices.
- You test the app.
- You use git properly.
- We love easter eggs ðŸ˜Ž
